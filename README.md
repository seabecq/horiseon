# horiseon

##Description 

Horiseon is a company that provides multiple online services. I was given the code with the request of improving it. The following code uses semantic and organized html and css to improve access by search engines and legibility. This should allow for the longevity of the code and expanded userbase. This project was an exercise in organizing code by best practice and adding semantic html.
